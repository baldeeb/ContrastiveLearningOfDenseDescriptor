# ContrastiveLearningOfDenseDescriptor


# TODO items
 - [ ] only keep one form of the data in the data dict and supplament that with function to derive others. Example: rgb and image are duplicates.
    - [ ] remove rgb key from dataset





# Demanding Tasks: 
- [ ] **Figure out the effect of batch size** 
    - [ ] integrate the ability to increase batch size if needed
- [x] **Matching pairs of pixels in augmented images.** _Those are necessary for the basic matching loss_
- [ ] **Better code the loss functions** _Matching loss seemed too complicated_
